# DevToolBox


## How is organized DevToolBox ?

DevToolBox is organized into two main folders at the root level: "Linux" for scripts specific to a Linux (bash) environment, and "Macos" for scripts specific to a macOS (zsh) environment. Within each of these folders, there are seven category folders:

1. System: Contains scripts for system-related tasks such as system updates, hardware configuration, driver installation, etc.
2. Multimedia: Includes scripts for installing and configuring multimedia software and tools.
3. Programming: Contains folders for various programming-related tasks, including IDE installation, code editors, package management, and more.
4. Devops: Holds scripts relevant to DevOps tasks such as container management, deployment, and infrastructure management.
5. Network: Includes scripts for network-related tasks like network configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
6. Others: Serves as a catch-all category for any scripts that don't fit into the other main categories.
7. Browsers: Contains scripts related to web browsers, such as installation, configuration, and plugins/extensions.
8. UsefulScripts: This folder houses scripts for automating common tasks and utilities helpful for developers.

With this organization, DevToolBox provides a clear and structured approach to accessing various scripts for specific purposes. Users can easily navigate the repository and find the scripts they need based on their specific requirements or interests.
Each subfolder of categories folders must contain a Readme file for explain how script work and how to use it.
