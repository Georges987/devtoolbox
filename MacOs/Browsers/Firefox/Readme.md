# Firefox Installation for macOS

This Bash script automates the process of installing Firefox on macOS systems. It downloads the latest version of Firefox, mounts the disk image, copies the application to the Applications folder, and cleans up the temporary files.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal on your macOS system.
2. Download the `install_firefox.sh` script or clone this repository.
3. Give the script execution permissions with the command `chmod +x install_firefox.sh`.
4. Execute the script with the command:

   `./install_firefox.sh`

5. Firefox will be downloaded, installed, and ready to use.

## Notes

- An active internet connection is required to download Firefox.
- This script does not require superuser privileges, as it installs Firefox in the user-accessible Applications folder.
- Ensure you have enough free space to download and install the application.
